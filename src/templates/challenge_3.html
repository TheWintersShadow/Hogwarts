<h3>Challenge 3:</h3>
Solve the collatz conjecture for the numbers 50,000 to 50,500. Find any reductions that reach the 222th step
(counting like a programmer) and save the number at that step. The flag is these numbers appended together in a string.
<br> <br>
For example, let's examine numbers 0-100 for step 111. The only two numbers that take 111 steps or more to compute are
73 (reduces to 8 at the 111th step) and 97 (reduces to 20 at the
111th step). No other numbers make it to this step. Therefore the flag would be "8"+"20" so "820".
